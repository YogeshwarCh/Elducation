        <h2>Seniors and technology</h2>
        <p>Barriers do exist when it comes to accessing and using technology. Many people lack basic skills due to the
            cost, as well as life circumstances. Devices, plus internet service and cellular phone service, are too
            expensive for many budgets.
            Technology changes quickly and unless you learn how to use it at school or work, it's even harder to stay
            current.
            But help is available in the community from Elducation.
            If you're teaching basic technology to seniors, use this simple step-by-step process when you’re providing
            help. You’ll find anyone, including students of all ages, can learn to use technology in no time.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2><u>Helpful ways you can help seniors learn new technology</u></h2>
        <h3>1. Start by addressing security concerns</h3>
        <p>We should all be concerned about security and keeping our private information safe. In an AARP study, 85% of
            adults ages 50 to 64 revealed that they were concerned about their privacy and data protection while on the
            internet.
            Help your students by showing them how to set secure passwords and download a password manager app on their
            devices so they don’t have to remember all the passwords to log in.
            Take a look at their privacy settings on social networks and show them how to set their information so that
            only friends can view it. Review privacy policies for websites where they might shop, bank, or share
            healthcare information and show them that the benefits, in most cases, outweigh the security risks.
        </p><br>
        <h3>2. Emphasize internet safety</h3>
        <p>Online scammers are always inventing new tactics. As a teacher of technology, be sure that you're up-to-date
            on the latest concerns, including scams that begin with a phone call.
            Warn your students not to accept connection requests from anyone they don’t know on social media, never send
            personal information (such as credit card or social security numbers) via email, text or chat, and never
            click on suspicious links.
        </p><br>
        <h3>3. Take it slow</h3>
        <p>It’s always best to start small and have multiple sessions so you don’t give your students information
            overload.
            You might start with a FaceTime or Messenger call while you are in the same building but in separate rooms.
            Or, help them choose their favorite photo (or take a selfie) for their social media profile picture.
        </p><br>
        <h3>4. Write it down</h3>
        <p>As you move slowly through the different tasks your students may want to complete using technology, encourage
            them to write it down. Provide a notebook where they can log passwords and usernames (in case the password
            manager app doesn’t work or they can’t log into it), the URLs of their most useful websites, and details on
            how to use their apps.
            If they get lost or forget how to do something, they can jog their memory from their own handwriting.
        </p><br>
        <h3>5. Show patience—even when teaching gets repetitive</h3>
        <p>Ask any teacher and they'll tell you the importance of stopping frequently and taking time to answer
            questions.
            Step away from the keyboard or mobile device and let your students complete the steps themselves. The more
            engaged they are, the more they will absorb.
            You may need to repeat concepts or steps multiple times until your student gets the hang of using their
            favorite app or website. Tell them that’s okay. Remind them of times when they were the teacher and had to
            give their students several tries to get something right—whether it was teaching a child how to ride a bike
            or mentoring a new hire at work.
        </p><br>
        <h3>6. Guide them to free resources</h3>
        <p>Access to technology is about much more than knowing how to use it. Access is being able to afford devices in
            the first place.
            The good news is that there are many programs to help people access free and low-cost devices, internet
            service, and cellular phone service.
            We've compiled this list of free and inexpensive options to get you started. And, because devices are only
            as good as the broadband internet service they run on, we've included resources for low-cost home internet
            service. Plus, we've added a section about low-cost mobile phone service. Most of these resources are
            available to people ages 65 and up, but some are available to all ages.
        </p><br>
        <h3>7. Explore games to get used to technology</h3>
        <p>Games are a great way to get your students engaged with technology. Crossword puzzles, Scrabble, or Soduku
            are great places to start.
            Download an app or give them a website and show them how to play from their device. You can even play
            interactive games like Words with Friends or Animal Crossing together—which is another great way to show
            people how technology can help them connect with others.
        </p><br>
        <h3>8. Adapt devices to meet physical needs</h3>
        <p>Many of us have challenges beyond simply learning how to use technology. Small touchscreens may be
            challenging for anyone with arthritis. Those with vision problems may not be able to read the words on a
            screen.
            Many websites today are designed to be ADA-accessible, which means people can use a text reader app to hear
            the words written on the screen. You can also set the mobile device or computer resolution to make the words
            larger.
        </p><br>
        <h3>9. Help students keep their skills sharp</h3>
        <p>Encourage your students to practice using their computer or mobile device so they can get more comfortable
            with technology. Plan FaceTime or Zoom calls instead of regular calls, and interact on social media.
        </p><br>
        <h3>10. Support others in your community</h3>
        <p>If you're tech savvy and would like to teach tech in your community, consider becoming a Elducation companion
            caregiver. It's a flexible part-time role where you can give back to the community while earning extra
            income. As a Elducation, you can support seniors, older adults, and families with a variety of tasks,
            including teaching basic technology.
